# AP Calculus BC Graphing Calculator Project
Graphing calculator project created for AP Calculus BC. This is made in Javascript and uses math.js

# What we need to accomplish
-Graph any polynomial and highlight removable discontinuities DONE (for the most part)

-Graph logarithmic, trignometric, and exponential functions DONE

-Graph f'(x) and f''(x) DONE

-Highlight relative max/min DONE

-Highlight POIs DONE

-Calculate FTC given f'(x) for any two points on the domain  DONE

-Software block diagram, printout of code w/ comments --DOING--

-Derivative Algorithm DONE

-Integration Algorithm DONE

-FTC Algorithm --Gotta Redo--

-Powerpoint/ Google Slides for Presentation --DOING--

# AP Calculus BC Graphing Calculator Project
Graphing calculator project created for AP Calculus BC. This is made in Javascript and uses math.js and plotly.js

# What we need to accomplish
-Graph any polynomial and highlight removable discontinuities

-Graph logarithmic, trignometric, and exponential functions

-Graph f'(x) and f''(x)

-Highlight relative max/min

-Highlight POIs

-Calculate FTC given f'(x) for any two points on the domain

-Software block diagram, printout of code w/ comments

-Derivative Algorithm

-Integration Algorithm

-FTC Algorithm

-Powerpoint/ Google Slides for Presentation
